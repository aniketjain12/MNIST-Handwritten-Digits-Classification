I can help create a README file for your GitHub repository based on the content of the notebook you've provided. I'll first review the notebook to gather the necessary details, and then I'll draft the README.

Let me take a look at the notebook.

Based on the content of the notebook, it appears to be a starter project for training a neural network on the MNIST dataset using PyTorch. The notebook includes sections for data loading, model definition, training, and evaluation. Here's a draft for the README file:

# MNIST Handwritten Digits Classification

This repository contains a starter notebook for training a neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using PyTorch.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to train a simple feedforward neural network to classify images of handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Uses `torchvision` to load the MNIST dataset and apply basic transformations.
- **Model Architecture**: A simple feedforward neural network with multiple fully connected layers.
- **Training**: The model is trained using a cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.
- **Evaluation**: The model's accuracy and loss are evaluated on the test set.

## Dependencies

To run the code, you need to install the required Python packages. You can install them using the provided `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the notebook**:
    Open the `MNIST_Handwritten_Digits_STARTER.ipynb` notebook and run the cells sequentially to train the model.

## Results

After training, the model achieves the following results:

- **Training Accuracy**: Varies per epoch (displayed during training)
- **Validation Accuracy**: Varies per epoch (displayed during evaluation)
- **Final Model**: The trained model is saved as `checkpoint.pth`.

## Repository Structure

- `MNIST_Handwritten_Digits_STARTER.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the code.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of required Python packages.
- `checkpoint.pth`: The trained model (generated after running the notebook).
